# SQL Deforestation Project
### A SQL project from Udacity using deforestation data to explore patterns and salient facts. 

This is presented as a pdf with fact and figures for the first several pages, with the actual SQL code written following. The SQL code is also available in a python script for ease of access. The actual data is not included here.  

I used SQL to join several subsheets of data together to identify top country and regions as well as total percent of forest area and how all of that information changed over time.
